# Monitoring dashboard example config
#
# Includes Google OAuth2 credentials from the mail example (SOPS-encrypted).
# No need to duplicate tokens -- kstlib resolves relative include paths
# and stores OAuth tokens in ~/.config/kstlib/auth/tokens/.
#
# Requirements:
#   - sops binary installed and in PATH
#   - Age private key matching the recipient in mail.conf.sops.yml
#     (check with: kstlib secrets doctor)
